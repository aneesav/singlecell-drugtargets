# Predicting drug targets from scRNA-seq data

Environmental enteropathy (EE) is a subclinical condition of the small intestine that is highly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries.

Although EE has been shown to be the by-product of a recurrent enteric infection, its full pathophysiology remains unclear. In this paper, researchers mapped the cellular and molecular correlates of EE by performing high-throughput, single-cell RNA-sequencing on 33 small intestinal biopsies from 11 adults with EE in Lusaka, Zambia (eight HIV-negative and three HIV-positive), six adults without EE in Boston, United States, and two adults in Durban, South Africa.

In this notebook, we will take their analyses a step further, and apply machine learning to single-cell genomics data to predict potential drug targets for EE
